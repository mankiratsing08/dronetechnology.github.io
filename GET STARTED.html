<p style="font-size:160%; margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black; color:#0033cc"><b>The History Of Drones</b></p> 

<p style="font-size:100%; margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black">Drones have a long history, dating back to 1849 in Italy, when Venice was fighting Austria for freedom. Austrian forces attacked Venice using bomb-laden hot-air, hydrogen or helium-filled balloons.
<br>
    <br>
During World War I, the first pilotless radio-controlled aircraft were employed. The experimental Kettering Bug, an unmanned "flying bomb" aircraft created by the US Army in 1918, was never utilised in combat.
    <br>
    <br>
    In 1935, a full-size retooling of the de Havilland DH82B "Queen Bee" biplane, which was fitted with a radio and servo-operated controls in the back seat, became the first widely deployed drone. The plane could be piloted normally from the front seat, but it mostly flew unmanned and was fired upon by artillery gunners in training. This is where the name "drone" came from, as a play on the "Queen Bee" moniker.
    
    <br>
    <Br>
        The military continued to be interested in UAV technology, but it was often too unstable and expensive to operate. The military reviewed the question of unmanned aerial vehicles when concerns about spy planes being shot down arose. Drones were quickly being used by the military to drop leaflets and act as espionage decoys.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 1982, the Israeli Air Force utilised unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to destroy the Syrian fleet with minimum Israeli casualties. Israeli UAVs served as decoys, jamming communications and providing real-time video surveillance.
        <br>
        <br>
        Drones have been a mainstay in the military, serving in intelligence, surveillance, and force protection, as well as artillery spotting, target following and acquisition, battle damage assessment, and reconnaissance.

<p style="font-size:100%; margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black">Drones are used for a number of objectives, including recreation, photography, commercial, and military applications, but their two primary tasks are flying and navigation.
<br>
    <Br>
        
        Drones have a power source, such as a battery or fuel, as well as rotors, propellers, and a frame, which allow them to fly. A drone's structure is often composed of lightweight composite materials to minimise weight and improve mobility while in flight.</p>

    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black; color:#0033cc"><b>Technology, features and components</b></p> 

    <p style="font-size:100%; margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black">Drones contain a large number of technological components, including:
        <li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Electronic Speed Controllers (ESC), an electronic circuit that controls a motor’s speed and direction.
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Flight controller
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">GPS module
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Battery
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Antenna
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Receiver
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Cameras
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Sensors, including ultrasonic sensors and collision avoidance sensors
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Accelerometer, which measures speed
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Altimeter, which measures altitude</li>
        
    <p style="font-size:100%; margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black">Any discussion of drone features is inextricably linked to the drone's type and use case, which includes recreational, photography, commercial, and military applications. Here are some examples of features:
        
        <li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Camera type, video resolution, megapixels and media storage format
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Maximum flight time, such as how long the drone can remain in the air
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Maximum speeds, including ascent and descent
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Hover accuracy
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Obstacle sensory range
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Altitude hold, which keeps the drone at a fixed altitude
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Live video feed
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Flight logs

    <p style="font-size:160%; margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black; color:#0033cc"><b>Types Of Drones</b></p>
    
<p style="font-size:100%; margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black">Drone platforms are divided into two categories: rotor, which includes single-rotor and multi-rotor aircraft (such as tricopters, quadcopters, hexacopters, and octocopters), and fixed-wing, which includes hybrid VTOL aircraft (vertical takeoff and landing) Drones that don't need to land on runways.
<br>
    <br>
    Drones are divided into two categories: personal/hobbyist and commercial/enterprise.
    <br>
    <Br> 
        Many consumer drones are now available, including HD video and still camera capabilities, as well as the ability to simply fly around. Drones often range in weight from less than a pound to ten pounds.
        <br>
            <br>
            Drones that are more powerful and capable are also available for commercial purposes. The ScanEagle, for example, from Insitu, a Boeing subsidiary, has a 10-foot wingspan and weighs 35 pounds. The Integrator, an 80-pound aircraft with a 16-foot wingspan, is also built by the business. Insitu drones do not take off and land on runways like aeroplanes; instead, they take off and land using the company's SkyHook launchers. Electro-optic imagers, mid-wave infrared imagers, infrared markers, and laser rangefinders are among the sensors available.
        <br>
        <br>
        Boeing revealed in 2018 that it had developed a prototype for an unmanned electric VTOL cargo air vehicle (CAV) capable of hauling a payload of up to 500 pounds.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another possibility is tethered drones, which have the obvious drawback of being physically linked to a base station. If the tether provides a direct power supply, certain tethered drones can overcome the power supply difficulty that many drones confront. For example, Elistair's Safe-T tethering station for drones has 2.5 kW of power and can fly to heights of more than 200 feet, with data transfer speeds of up to 200 Mb/s.

<p style="font-size:160%; margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black; color:#0033cc"><b>Drones used for Business and Industry</b></p> 
            
      <p style="font-size:100%; margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black">Outside of the military, the use of drones has exploded in the last decade. UAVs are employed in drone journalism, search and rescue, disaster response, asset protection, animal monitoring, firefighting, communications relay, healthcare, and agriculture, in addition to surveillance and delivery applications.
          <br>
          <br>
          Drones and internet of things (IoT) technology have spawned a slew of new business applications. Drones combined with on-ground IoT sensor networks can assist agricultural organisations in monitoring land and crops, energy companies in surveying power lines and operational equipment, and insurance companies in monitoring claims and policies.          
        <br>
          <br>
          Drones can potentially "connect the dots" using IoT, according to a 2015 trial in Austin, Texas. A security tech firm teamed up with a drone startup to search for Zigbee beacons in order to get a sense of what IoT networks were present in the city's residential and commercial areas. The outcomes were said to be swift and instructional by the companies.
          <br>
          <br>
          Unmanned aerial vehicles and the Internet of Things (IoT) are commonly mentioned in the same breath as logistics, agriculture, and security, providing a component in pervasive connectivity and interaction.
          <br>
          <br>
          Other applications and functions of drones include:
<li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Farmers can use drones to help them measure and record the height of their crops. They employ Lidar, a remote sensing system that uses a laser to illuminate the crop and measures what is reflected back to compute distance.
    

  <li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Drones equipped with biological sensors can fly to dangerous places to measure air quality and look for certain microorganisms or atmospheric ingredients.
      
      <li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Drones can examine the size of damaged areas and determine how quickly the fires are growing during wildfires. Images can be used to show the extent of the devastation in certain places.
          <li style= "margin-left: 10%; border:0px solid black; margin-right: 10%; border:0px solid black;">Television sports networks employ drones to record footage from athletic events, such as taped and live flyover footage, that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. Drones must be used in accordance with FAA, sports league, venue, and local law enforcement rules.</li>
